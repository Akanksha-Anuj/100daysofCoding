### Coding problems tackled today:

- You are given two arrays, A and B, of equal size N. The task is to find the minimum value of A[0] _ B[0] + A[1] _ B[1] + .... + A[N-1] \* B[N-1], where shuffling of elements of arrays A and B is allowed.
- You are given an array A of n elements. There are two players player 1 and player 2.
  A player can choose any of element from an array and remove it. If the bitwise XOR of all remaining elements equals 0 after removal of the selected element, then that player loses. Find out the winner if player 1 starts the game and they both play their best.
- Given two unsorted arrays A of size N and B of size M of distinct elements, the task is to find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X.Note: All pairs should be printed in increasing order of u. For eg. for two pairs (u1,v1) and (u2,v2), if u1 < u2 then
  (u1,v1) should be printed first else second.

The third problem needs to be revisited as it is difficult to solve in Javascript
